            <P>　　The following are common problems reported by users, please check:</P>
            <HR>
            <P><STRONG>　　1. Why is my game record suddenly cleared?</STRONG></P>
            <P>　　Answer: All game data except the balance in the game are saved locally. Please do not uninstall the game, clear the game data or use cleaning tools to clean up the game. </P>
            <P><STRONG>　　2. Why do I need to provide identification information for withdrawal?</STRONG></P>
            <P>　　Answer: Identity information is necessary for paypal. We will delete the identity information you provided after the payment is successful, and will not use your information for other purposes. </P>
            <P><STRONG>　　3. Why is my actual credited amount missing a few cents or a few cents?</STRONG></P>
            <P>　　Answer: After the cumulative withdrawal amount exceeds a certain value, taxes and fees must be paid in accordance with regulations, so the actual amount received will be slightly less than a few cents or a few cents. </P>
            <P><STRONG>　　4. Why is the payment speed slow?</STRONG></P>
            <P>　　Answer: We currently use manual payment method, and the amount involved is relatively large, so it takes up to 7 working days to review and make payment operations, please understand. At present, the automatic payment system is under intense development. We expect to officially use automatic payment after January 5, 2020, when the payment speed will be greatly accelerated. </P>
            <P><STRONG>　　5. Why can't I watch the video sometimes?</STRONG></P>
            <P>　　Answer: The video cannot be watched because the mobile network is unstable, the server requests too many people, or the ads on the advertising platform are not filled. Please check the network, wait a while or restart the game and try again. </P>
            <P><STRONG>　　6. What should I do if I log out by mistake?</STRONG></P>
            <P>　　Answer: We are unable to resume logout for you, please read the relevant agreement carefully before logout. </P>
            <P><STRONG>　　7. I am an Apple user, can I invite Android users?</STRONG></P>
            <P>　　Answer: The data of Apple and Android users are not interoperable and cannot be invited across systems. </P>
